# While Loop Task

Use these questions to practice writing while loops.

You will do your work in the files named for each question.

## Question 1

In the file `q1.py`, write a program that prints "Hello" 20 times.

## Question 2

In the file `q2.py`, write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.

## Question 3

In the file `q3.py`, write a program that prints the numbers from 50 to 1000, counting by 5.

## Question 4

In the file `q4.py`, write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints from that number down to 0, then prints "Blast Off!".

## Question 5

In the file `q5.py`, write a program that asks the user for a base number and then prints the first 10 powers of that base number.

For example, if the base number is 2, then its powers are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...

## Question 6

In the file `q6.py`, write a program that asks the user for a length and a width.  Print a multiplication table with that length and width.  The numbers should be separated by tabs.

For example, if the length and width were 5 and 8 respectively, then the output should be:
```
1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
2    4    6    8    10   12   14   16
3    6    9    12   15   18   21   24
4    8    12   16   20   24   28   32
5    10   15   20   25   30   35   40
```

NOTE: You will need to **nest** a loop inside of another loop to do this question.

# Write a program that asks the user for a length and a width.  Print a 
# multiplication table with that length and width.  The numbers should be 
# separated by tabs.
# 
# For example, if the length and width were 5 and 8 respectively, then the 
# output should be:
#
# 1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
# 2    4    6    8    10   12   14   16
# 3    6    9    12   15   18   21   24
# 4    8    12   16   20   24   28   32
# 5    10   15   20   25   30   35   40
# 
# NOTE: You will need to **nest** a loop inside of another loop to do this 
# question.
